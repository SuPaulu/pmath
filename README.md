# pmath
a c++ header file that includes physics math formulae!!

## DISCLAIMER: this pmath is only a demonstration of how custom header files in c++ works.

# HOW TO USE:
you may copy and paste, or download pmath.hpp into an empty file, or on to your project's root folder. Ensure that they are on the same folder as your source file.

## Projectile Distance ```ProjDist()```:
  Measures the distance traveled of projectiles in meters.

## Simple Velocity ```SimpVelo()```:
  Calculates for velocity using the formula distance in meters divided over time in seconds.

## Simple Time ```SimpTime()```:
  Calculates for time using the formula distance in meters divided over velocity in meters per seconds.

## Simple Distance ```SimpDist()```:
  Calculates for distance using the formula velocity in meters per seconds multiplied by time in seconds.

## Velocity To Speed ```vToSpeed()```
  Converts velocity to speed in kilometers per hour by multiplying velocity to 3.6 (1 m/s = 3.6 km/h)
